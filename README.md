This work aims to develop an explainable and explicit data-driven model for predicting CO₂ storage and oil production.

The development of a graphic user interface (GUI) named CCS-EOROptTool aims to facilitate quick and intelligent predictions of CO₂ storage and cumulative oil production in unconventional reservoirs. 

The graphical user interface allows users to input reservoir and operational parameters and then view live predictions of stored CO₂ mass and cumulative oil partitioned with associated uncertainty intervals. This workflow is enable quick and smart decision making and it is transparent enough to support engineering judgment in unconventional plays.
